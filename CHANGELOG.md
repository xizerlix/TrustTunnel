# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [Feature] Traffic quotas on top of v1.1.0: `max_traffic_bytes` per client in
  `credentials.toml`, optional `default_max_traffic_bytes_per_client` and
  `traffic_usage_file` in `vpn.toml`. Clients over quota are blocked from new
  VPN requests. `/clients` includes `ips[]` (with `#ip_*` tags), `total`,
  `limit`, and `quota_exceeded`.
- [Feature] `limit_inbound_handshakes` in `vpn.toml` (default `true`) toggles
  the TCP accept / concurrent TLS caps. When enabled,
  `max_concurrent_inbound_handshakes` (default `32`) sets the concurrent TLS
  session cap. Set `limit_inbound_handshakes = false` when several clients
  share one NAT IP and reconnects stall.

### Changed

- [Fix] Unauthenticated admin pages redirect to login instead of JSON.
  Save accepts a single form field as well as a repeated sequence.
  The dashboard auto-refreshes every 5s, colors service status with uptime
  or downtime, reads live sessions from `/clients` and `/metrics` without
  waiting for the metrics socket to close, and shows spent traffic from
  `traffic_usage_file` even when no quota is set.
- [Fix] Drop default `tcp_connections_timeout_secs` from one week to two hours
  so dead NAT sockets cannot occupy a client's `connection_limiter` slots for
  days and starve fresh VPN requests.
- [Fix] Remove the per-tunnel `Mutex` around the forwarder; the forwarder is
  immutable for the tunnel's lifetime, so the lock only added contention under
  the multiplexed request spawns on a 1-CPU host.
- [Fix] `ConnectionLimiter` counters are `AtomicU32` with a `RwLock`-guarded
  map lookup; per-client slot accounting no longer serialises on a single
  mutex for every HTTP/2 multiplexed request.
- [Fix] `udp_forwarder` reuses a `BytesMut` instead of copying the full
  `MAX_UDP_PAYLOAD_SIZE` (~64 KiB) into a fresh `Bytes` on every datagram.
- [Fix] SOCKS5 control connections enable TCP keepalive so the upstream
  tunnel does not die silently between bursts.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- [Fix] Enable TCP keepalive on inbound and tunneled outbound sockets (60s
  idle, 15s probes) so NAT idle timeouts are less likely to drop live VPN
  streams. Prefer X25519 over X25519MLKEM768, cache rustls `ServerConfig`,
  drop scanner ClientHellos with no ALPN, silence rustls `WARN`, default to
  at least two tokio workers, and count quota bytes with atomics so persist
  cannot stall the data path.
  data path. Cap *new* TCP accepts (128/s per IP, 512/s global) and concurrent
  TLS handshakes (32) so a scanner cannot pin a 1-CPU host, without dropping a
  normal reconnect burst of ~10 users with many HTTP/2 sessions.
- [Fix] Fork release workflow sets `TRUSTTUNNEL_VERSION` from the git tag so
  `trusttunnel_endpoint --version` reports `custom-*` instead of `0.0.0-git`.
- [Fix] `custom-1.1.1` accept/handshake caps (24/s per IP, 80/s global, 8 TLS)
  dropped legitimate reconnects after restart; raised and logged at `warn`.

### Security

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- [Feature] Optional per-user metrics behind the `per_client_metrics` metrics
  config flag (default `false`). When enabled, `/metrics` additionally exposes
  `client_sessions_per_user`, `inbound_traffic_bytes_per_user`, and
  `outbound_traffic_bytes_per_user` labelled with the authenticated `username`,
  and a new `/clients` JSON endpoint reports per-user aggregates (sessions,
  traffic, IP). Aggregate metrics are unchanged. Exposes usernames and client
  IPs, so only enable it on a protected metrics listener.

### Changed

- The released version is now derived from the git tag instead of a hardcoded value; `trusttunnel_endpoint --version` reports the version of the tag it was built from.

### Fixed

- `allow_private_network_connections = false` no longer blocks the `[reverse_proxy]` `server_address`: the origin server address comes from the endpoint configuration, so a loopback or private address stays reachable while tunneled client traffic to private networks remains forbidden.
- `is_global_ipv6` incorrectly classified global unicast IPv6 addresses (e.g. `2001:4860:4860::8888`) as non-global.
- UDP timeout cleanup no longer leaks outbound sockets: the expired-connection path now passes the reverse-oriented meta to `on_connection_closed`, matching the direct forwarder's orientation contract so the kernel UDP socket and its `outbound_udp_sockets` metric are actually released after `udp_connections_timeout_secs` of inactivity.

## [1.0.41] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- `non_connect_auth_failure_status_code` config key to control the HTTP status code returned on authentication failure for non-CONNECT requests. Extend allowed values for `auth_failure_status_code` and `non_connect_auth_failure_status_code` to 407, 405, 404, and 403.

## [1.0.28] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `trusttunnel_endpoint -c` can now generate `client_random_prefix` values automatically, append matching allow rules to `rules.toml`, and embed the generated value into exported client configs.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- `ping_enable`, `ping_path`, `speedtest_enable` and `speedtest_path` config keys to configure ping and speedtest handlers.
- `auth_failure_status_code` config key to control the HTTP status code returned on authentication failure (407 or 405). Defaults to 407.

### Fixed

- Reverse proxy routing for H2/H3.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- HTTP/1.1 codec busy loop when receiving partial request headers.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Change deep-link format from `tt://` to `tt://?`. For backward compatibility, `tt://` is still supported.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-03-02

### Security

- Fixed traffic leaking to local network via UDP, ICMP, and SOCKS5 forwarders
  when `allow_private_network_connections` is set to `false`.
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to UDP forwarder
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to ICMP forwarder
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to SOCKS5 forwarder (TCP and UDP)
    - Handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:x.x.x.x`) in `is_global_ip`
  (Based on [GitHub PR #79](https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/pull/79) by @andrew-morris)

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Per-client connection limits
    - Optional limits for simultaneous HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections per client credentials
    - Global default limits via `default_max_http2_conns_per_client` and `default_max_http3_conns_per_client` in main config
    - Per-client overrides via `max_http2_conns` and `max_http3_conns` in credentials file
    - Applies to both SNI-authenticated and proxy-basic authenticated connections
    - For proxy-basic: limit enforced on first authenticated request (not idle connections)

  API changes in the library:
    - Added `max_http2_conns` and `max_http3_conns` fields to `authentication::registry_based::Client`
    - Added `default_max_http2_conns_per_client` and `default_max_http3_conns_per_client` fields to `settings::Settings`
    - Added new `connection_limiter` module with `ConnectionLimiter` and `ConnectionGuard` types
    - Added `connection_limiter` field to `core::Context`

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Support for X25519MLKEM768 post-quantum group.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- The `-a` flag now accepts `domain` and `domain:port` in addition to `ip` and `ip:port`.
  The exported client configuration will contain the domain name, which the client resolves via DNS at connect time.
- Deep-link format (`tt://`) now supports domain names in the `addresses` field.
- When listening on `[::]`, the endpoint now explicitly sets `IPV6_V6ONLY=false` to accept
  both IPv4 and IPv6 connections on a single socket (dual-stack).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- New `trusttunnel-deeplink` library crate for encoding/decoding `tt://` URIs
- `client_random_prefix` field to client configuration export
    - New CLI option `--client-random-prefix`
    - Validates hex format and checks against `rules.toml`

  when a numeric address was used.
