# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [Feature] Per-client metrics: `client_sessions`, `inbound_traffic_bytes`, and `outbound_traffic_bytes` now include a `username` label; new `/clients` JSON endpoint on the metrics listener returns per-user sessions, traffic totals, limits, and quota status.
- [Feature] `/clients` JSON: `ips` array with `address` and `#ip_*` `tag` per connected client address; unauthenticated entries are omitted from the response.
- [Feature] Traffic quotas: `max_traffic_bytes` per client in `credentials.toml`, optional `default_max_traffic_bytes_per_client` and `traffic_usage_file` in `vpn.toml`; clients over quota are blocked from new VPN requests.

### Changed

- [Feature] Prometheus traffic counters (`inbound_traffic_bytes`, `outbound_traffic_bytes`) are now labeled by `username` instead of `protocol_type`.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- `is_global_ipv6` incorrectly classified global unicast IPv6 addresses (e.g. `2001:4860:4860::8888`) as non-global.

### Security

## [1.0.41] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- `non_connect_auth_failure_status_code` config key to control the HTTP status code returned on authentication failure for non-CONNECT requests. Extend allowed values for `auth_failure_status_code` and `non_connect_auth_failure_status_code` to 407, 405, 404, and 403.

## [1.0.28] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `trusttunnel_endpoint -c` can now generate `client_random_prefix` values automatically, append matching allow rules to `rules.toml`, and embed the generated value into exported client configs.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- `ping_enable`, `ping_path`, `speedtest_enable` and `speedtest_path` config keys to configure ping and speedtest handlers.
- `auth_failure_status_code` config key to control the HTTP status code returned on authentication failure (407 or 405). Defaults to 407.

### Fixed

- Reverse proxy routing for H2/H3.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- HTTP/1.1 codec busy loop when receiving partial request headers.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Change deep-link format from `tt://` to `tt://?`. For backward compatibility, `tt://` is still supported.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-03-02

### Security

- Fixed traffic leaking to local network via UDP, ICMP, and SOCKS5 forwarders
  when `allow_private_network_connections` is set to `false`.
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to UDP forwarder
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to ICMP forwarder
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to SOCKS5 forwarder (TCP and UDP)
    - Handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:x.x.x.x`) in `is_global_ip`
  (Based on [GitHub PR #79](https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/pull/79) by @andrew-morris)

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Per-client connection limits
    - Optional limits for simultaneous HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections per client credentials
    - Global default limits via `default_max_http2_conns_per_client` and `default_max_http3_conns_per_client` in main config
    - Per-client overrides via `max_http2_conns` and `max_http3_conns` in credentials file
    - Applies to both SNI-authenticated and proxy-basic authenticated connections
    - For proxy-basic: limit enforced on first authenticated request (not idle connections)

  API changes in the library:
    - Added `max_http2_conns` and `max_http3_conns` fields to `authentication::registry_based::Client`
    - Added `default_max_http2_conns_per_client` and `default_max_http3_conns_per_client` fields to `settings::Settings`
    - Added new `connection_limiter` module with `ConnectionLimiter` and `ConnectionGuard` types
    - Added `connection_limiter` field to `core::Context`

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Support for X25519MLKEM768 post-quantum group.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- The `-a` flag now accepts `domain` and `domain:port` in addition to `ip` and `ip:port`.
  The exported client configuration will contain the domain name, which the client resolves via DNS at connect time.
- Deep-link format (`tt://`) now supports domain names in the `addresses` field.
- When listening on `[::]`, the endpoint now explicitly sets `IPV6_V6ONLY=false` to accept
  both IPv4 and IPv6 connections on a single socket (dual-stack).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- New `trusttunnel-deeplink` library crate for encoding/decoding `tt://` URIs
- `client_random_prefix` field to client configuration export
    - New CLI option `--client-random-prefix`
    - Validates hex format and checks against `rules.toml`
    - Added to deep-link format as tag 0x0B

### Added

- GPG signing of the endpoint binaries.

## [0.9.122] - 2026-01-30

### Changed

- Endpoint now requires credentials when listening on a public address.

## [0.9.115] - 2026-01-23

  (<https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/security/advisories/GHSA-fqh7-r5gf-3r87>)

## [0.9.114] - 2026-01-23

### Security

- Fixed an issue where `allow_private_network_connections` set to false could be bypassed
  when a numeric address was used.
